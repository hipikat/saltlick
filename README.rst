Saltlick is a delicious, convenient lump of Saltâ€¦ utilities
===========================================================

**This project is definitely 'pre-alpha'**

Saltlick is working towards becoming a convenient package for working
with clusters orchestrated by Salt.

Some things it does, and some things it's learning to do:

- Installing Salt for development (in a virtualenv)
- Bootstrap Salted machines with Vagrant
- Manages states, pillars and formulas via pillars
- Manages deploy keys for things like states and pillars
- Manages Salt configuration, such as for Salt Cloud
- Migrate Salted machines
- Create Salted machine images
